I am a 4th year PhD student at the Helsinki Graduate School of Economics mainly interested in industrial organization and health economics. Most of my current research is focused on pharmaceutical markets: I study entry, mergers and acquisitions as well as firm, patient and physician behaviour in these markets.

**Additional Public Procurement in Health Services: Lessons from Finnish Physiotherapy Markets**
*In Journal of the Finnish Economic Association (2024) Vol. 5 No. 1 with Visa Pitkänen,* **[LINK](https://journal.fi/jfea/article/view/137938)**

Private firms are often acquired to provide publicly financed health services through public procurements. The number of contracted providers and their capacity may turn out to be deficient during the contract period. Typically, the purchasers then organize additional procurements or negotiate directly with available uncontracted providers to acquire more capacity. In this study, we examine an unusual additional public procurement in Finnish physiotherapy markets, in which incumbent providers with an existing contract were also eligible to participate. In practice, these contracted providers did not bear any risk when they submitted their bids in the additional procurement. We compare contracted and uncontracted providers’ prices to free market prices using a difference-in-differences approach. The results show that contracted providers increased their prices on average by 9%, while the originally uncontracted providers decreased their prices by 8% compared to the development of free market prices. Our calculations show that the additional procurement led to a waste of public funds by around 1.5 million euros over the contract period. We also present a simple theoretical framework for providers’ behaviour in additional public procurements.

**The Indirect Effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 Vaccination on Healthcare Workers’ Unvaccinated Household Members**
*In Nature Communications (2022) 13:1162 with Jussipekka Salo, Mika Kortelainen, Tuija Leino, Tanja Saxell, Markku Siikanen & Lauri Sääksvuori,* **[LINK](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28825-4)**


Mass vaccination is effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections among vaccinated individuals. However, it remains unclear how effectively COVID-19 vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus to their close contacts. Using nationwide administrative datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccination records, demographics, and unique household IDs, we conducted an observational cohort study to estimate the direct and indirect effectiveness of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in reducing infections among vaccinated healthcare workers and their unvaccinated household members. Our estimates for adults imply indirect effectiveness of 39.1% (95% CI: −7.1% to 65.3%) two weeks and 39.0% (95% CI: 18.9% to 54.0%) eight weeks after the second dose. We find that the indirect effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines within households is smaller for unvaccinated children than for adults and statistically insignificant. Here, we show that mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections not only among vaccinated individuals but also among unvaccinated adult household members in a real-world setting.
